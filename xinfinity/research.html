	To keep a distributed ledger system at its optimal performance, it is necessary to utilize the resources and avoid latency in its network. To achieve this goal, dynamically and effciently 
	injecting the unverified transactions to enable synchronicity based on the current system conguration and the traffic of the network is crucial. To reduce latency and
	provide optimization, we offer a distributed ledger architecture, Tango, that is based on the Iota-Tangle distributed system. We model periodic pulsed injections into the
	evaluation layer from the entry layer. To meet this need, we introduced four protocols: Decentralized Semi-synchronous Pulse Diffusion (DSPD) protocol,Pulsed Injection of 
	Transactions into the Evaluation Corridor (PITEC) protocol,Pulsed Transaction Injection Parameterization (PTIP) protocol and Verification Perfor-
	mance Optimizer (VPO) protocol. The DSPD Protocol lays out the roles of the participants in the network and introduces the diffusion mechanism for the controllers to provide semi-synchronicity to the system.
	The diffusion speed is dependent on the p2p network performance. The PITEC Protocol simulates the inventory system by estimating the optimal pulse injection size to be released
	for the verifiers at each periodic cycle in order to keep the system's performance. The PTIP protocol regulates the injection volume based on the performance from previous
	verification cycle. The VPO takes the capacity of the veriers pool as a constraint to optimize for various house policies. We observed that under property construction of the
	system, we can refine the parameters to integers such that dynamic programming to offer us a pseudo-polynomial complexity to solve this NP-hard optimization problem.

	Intrusion Detection systems for Cloud Hypervisors are vital due to the amount of Virtual
	Machines that would be aected in a possible compromise. A Cloud Hypervisor orchestrates, 
	manages many Virtual Machines, and their central role in cloud computing made
	them a target for the attackers. Intrusion detection has been mostly relied on signature
	based detection of malicious behaviour. However, when a new type of attack occurs it
	won't have a signature in the Intrusion Detection system's database. In those cases, behavior
	based anomaly detection produces better results in detection. In this work, we
	have started with a data-set provided by University of Victoria's ISOT lab, which includes
	2 weeks of logs, including network packet captures; memory dumps; disk, memory, CPU
	usage statistics; and more. The proposed method of anomaly detection only used vmstat
	and iostat command output generated on the cloud hypervisor, and developed algorithms
	to detect anomalies which indicates attacks. For anomaly detection we have evaluated
	values in the data-set in a sliding time window, where for each window a KL value is
	calculated and compared to the 3 previous windows. Our team
	open-sources the developed and implemented methods for anomaly detection.

      <h1 class="text-center animsition"> Cryptography</h1>		
	Cybersecurity has become a necessity for today's digital world. Cryptography has played
	an extremely critical role in cybersecurity for defending the privacy and integrity of the
	data. However, with recent advances in quantum technologies, it is likely many existing
	commonly used cryptosystems will be broken by quantum computers. Post-quantum
	cryptography is cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a large quantum
	computer; post-quantum cryptosystems strive to remain secure even in this scenario. It
	is known that hard instances of NP-complete problems cannot be solved "exactly" and
	"efficiently" by quantum computers. There are many candidate problems, such as shortest
	vector problem and closest vector problem in a lattice system, that can be further designed
	and used for post-quantum cryptography. This relatively young research area has seen
	some successes in identifying mathematical operations for which quantum algorithms oer
	little advantage in speed, and then building cryptographic systems around those. The
	central challenge in post-quantum cryptography is to meet demands for cryptographic
	usability and  exibility without sacrificing confidence.

      <h1 class="text-center animsition"> Quantum Computation and Communication</h1>		
	Quantum technologies have advanced dramatically in the past decade, both in theory
	and experiment. We are interested in working on exploring the applicability of the 
	advantages of quantum algorithms, such as quantum walks, with the near term quantum technologies
	via various reduction tecniques. pseudo random number generators and quantum machine learning. We are 
	also exploring quantum assisted blockchain structure via various quantum protocols.
